In July 2019 I received great news. I was IN a new learning program called MANAGER DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE [MDE]. Expectations where high. Who would tell me that time that coronavirus was going to temporally stop the program a few months later after giving me tools to deal with the new situation.
This post will show you an overview of these tools.

### What I've learned
Actually many things. Let's sum up:

#### 1. Create an habit
You can achive all you want if you keep at it. In my case I started with a 15 minutes meditation that I keep until now.

#### 2. Take care of yourself
It can sound obvious, but you can not give everything from you if you are not happy. Time for you: sleep well, read, do sport, healthy meals...

#### 3. Motivate others
How are we teaching and helping each other to learn and grow?
Role modeling ways to collaborate in cross-functional teams

#### 4. Receive feedback
One of the thing that always are complicated. if you don't know how other see your work you can not have a way to improve.

#### 5. Building relationships
Build GOOD relations. That means quality not quantity. Another take over was to think in a way to mesasure.

And everything became even more important these days. Examples:
1. I've created an habit for doing some work sport
2. I've continued with my meditation
3. I've take care about motivation with my team mates
4. I request for feedback, improvement points..
5. I tried to detect stakeholder that can provide me more benefit
