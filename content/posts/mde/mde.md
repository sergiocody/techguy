### Background
In July 2019 I received great news. I was included in a new learning program called MANAGER DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE [MDE]. Expectations where high: a new way of learning, a lot of practical workshops and showcase...
Who would tell me that time that coronavirus was going to temporally stop the program a few months later, but after giving me tools to deal with the new situation.
This post will show you an overview of these tools.

### What I've learned
Actually many things. Trough the workshops and practices we've made I realized of things that can be improved. Some of the key takeaways I want to talk about:

##### 1. Create (good) habits
You can achive many things if you keep at it. 
In my case as part of the program I started with a 15 minutes meditation time. It was a good learning as after some weeks it became an habbit. Since then, I've done the same for small like a "sport at home" session that improved my day to day.

##### 2. Take care of yourself
It can sound obvious, but you can not give everything from you if you are not healthy and happy. It's important to reflect. You need time for you and take care of yourself: 
- sleep well.. 8 hours is perfect
- read 
- practice some sport
- do meditation
- good nutrition and healthy meals...

##### 3. Motivate others
You have to think: how am I helping each other to learn and grow? It's important as you can be a role model of your colleagues. 
Furthermore, collaboration is a must. I thought about ways to being collaborative in cross-functional teams.

##### 4. Receive feedback
One of the things I like least :-) By default you don't want to ask for feedback... but it's crutial. Is the way to get real performance indicators of your work and find the path to improve.

##### 5. Building relationships
Build GOOD relationships... That means quality not quantity. Number of linkedin contact is not relevant... but connect with key people is.
Another great take over was the need to think in a way to mesasure these relationships with your stakeholders. Ask yourself: are you providing what your stakeholders are expecting? Are they influence in your backlog? How can I measure my impact?


### How I applied... working from home 

And everything became even more important after home office was a standard. MDE learning helped me in this situation, let's see how....

###### 1. Create good habits and take care of myself
Even more importan at home: along with my meditation habit, I've created an habit for doing some "home sport" at home.
Also, I've tried to sleep well, eat healthy, read a lot of books (I love it)...

###### 2. Motivate others
Do it remotly is always a challenge. But it really worth to invest time in it. 
First thing is always find your internal motivation: do the things with passion, always trying to improve yourself. If you get it you are in a good starting point to talk with your colleagues, and try to be a role model. Always try to give the best of you, with energy. And show it in every conversation or chat with them. 

###### 3. Receive feedback and build relationships
You can feel "isolate", so feedback about how you are doing became a key. I've learned to ask and have open talks with my colleagues.
Along with feedback, the need of building "remote" relationships with stakeholders is imperative. I've tried to detect the stakeholders that can provide us more benefit. A clear tracking of the feedback has been a good starting point. Then, have a fluid communications with my colleagues of the different areas has been important to identify pain points and improme my performance and the behaviour of the applications I'm responsible of.

Hope it helps. Thanks for reading :-)
