In July 2019 I received great news. I was IN a new learning program called MANAGER DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE [MDE]. Expectations where high. Who would tell me that time that coronavirus was going to temporally stop the program a few months later after giving me tools to deal with the new situation.
This post will show you an overview of these tools.

### What I've learned
Actually many things. Let's sum up:

#### 1. Create an habit
You can achive all you want if you keep at it. In my case I started with a 15 minutes meditation that I keep until now.

#### 2. Take care of yourself
It can sound obvious, but you can not give everything from you if you are not happy. Time for you: sleep well, read, do sport, healthy meals...

#### 3. Motivate others
Motivate and delegate.

#### 4. Receive feedback
One of the thing that always are complicated. if you don't know how other see your work you can not have a way to improve.

#### 5. Building relationships
Build GOOD relations. That means quality not quantity. Another take over was to think in a way to mesasure.

The skill and project cards are designed carefully to give more meaningful information. The skill cards not only just list your skills. It also gives the viewer an idea about your depth of knowledge of the particular skill. The project cards give an idea about the popularity of your project if it is an open-source project on Github.
