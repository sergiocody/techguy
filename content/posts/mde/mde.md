In July 2019 I received great news. I was IN a new learning program called MANAGER DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE [MDE]. Expectations where high. 
Who would tell me that time that coronavirus was going to temporally stop the program a few months later after giving me tools to deal with the new situation.
This post will show you an overview of these tools.

### What I've learned
Actually many things. Trough the workshops and practices I've realized of things that can be improved.

##### 1. Create an (good) habit
You can achive all you want if you keep at it. 
In my case as part of the program I started with a 15 minutes meditation time. After some weeks it became an habbit. Since then, I've done the same for small thing that improved my day to day.

##### 2. Take care of yourself
It can sound obvious, but you can not give everything from you if you are not happy. It's important to reflect. You need time for you and take care of yourself: 
- sleep well.. 8 hours is perfect
- read 
- practice some sport
- do meditation
- good nutrition and healthy meals...

##### 3. Motivate others
You have to think: how am I helping each other to learn and grow? It's important as you can be a role model of your colleagues. 
Furthermore, collaboration is a must. I thought about ways to being collaborative in cross-functional teams.

##### 4. Receive feedback
One of the thing that always are complicated. By default you don't want to ask for feedback... but it's crutial. Is the way to get real performance indicators of your work and find the path to improve.

##### 5. Building relationships
Build GOOD relationships... That means quality not quantity. 
Another great take over was to think in a way to mesasure these relationships woth your stakeholders.. are you providing what they are expecting? Are they influence in your backlog? How can I measure my impact?

All MDE learning helped me in this situation:

###### 1. Create good habits are even more importan at home: I've created an habit for doing some work sport
###### 2. Take care of yourself physicaly an mentally is even more important: I've continued with my meditation, practicing sport, sleep well, read a lot...
###### 3. Motivate remotly is always a challenge. But it really worth to invest time in it.
###### 4. You can feel "isolate" so request for feedback became a key. 
###### 5. The need of building "remote" relationships with stakeholders is an imperative thing. I used my background experience to detect stakeholder that can provide me more benefit and improve the relationships.
