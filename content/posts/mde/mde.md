In July 2019 I received great news. I was IN a new learning program called MANAGER DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE [MDE]. Expectations where high. 
Who would tell me that time that coronavirus was going to temporally stop the program a few months later after giving me tools to deal with the new situation.
This post will show you an overview of these tools.

### What I've learned
Actually many things. Let's sum up:

##### 1. Create an habit
You can achive all you want if you keep at it. In my case as part of the program I started with a 15 minutes meditation time. After some weeks it became an habbit. I've done the same for create an sport at home habbit.

##### 2. Take care of yourself
It can sound obvious, but you can not give everything from you if you are not happy. It's important to reflect. You need time for you and take care of yourself: 
- sleep well.. 8 hours is perfect
- read 
- practice some sport
- good nutrition and healthy meals...

##### 3. Motivate others
How are we teaching and helping each other to learn and grow? It's important to reflect how you can be a role model of your colleagues. 
Furthermore, being collaborative in cross-functional teams is a plus.

##### 4. Receive feedback
One of the thing that always are complicated. By default you don't want to ask for feedback... but it's crutial. Is the way to get real performance indicators of your work and find the path to improve.

##### 5. Building relationships
Build GOOD relationships... That means quality not quantity. 
Another great take over was to think in a way to mesasure these relationships woth your stakeholders.. are you providing what they are expecting? Are they influence in your backlog? How can I measure my impact?

##### 4. I request for feedback, improvement points..
##### 5. I tried to detect stakeholder that can provide me more benefit
