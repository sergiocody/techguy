In July 2019 I received great news. I was IN a new learning program called MANAGER DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE [MDE]. Expectations where high. Who would tell me that time that coronavirus was going to temporally stop the program a few months later after giving me tools to deal with the new situation.
This post will present you an overview of these tools.

### How it help me these days

The skill and project cards are designed carefully to give more meaningful information. The skill cards not only just list your skills. It also gives the viewer an idea about your depth of knowledge of the particular skill. The project cards give an idea about the popularity of your project if it is an open-source project on Github.

### An Experience Timeline that truly represents your experiences

The experience timeline has been designed to reflect your career background. It shows the responsibilities you have handled in various stages of your career.

### A sidebar that makes sense

Did you ever find yourself spending lots of time to find a particular post on a blog? I did it too. This theme incorporates a sidebar menu that categorizes your posts in various categories and sub-categories.
